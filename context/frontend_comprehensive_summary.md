# Comprehensive Frontend Summary

## Overview
The frontend is a React application (bootstrapped with Create React App) written in TypeScript. It provides a modern, interactive user interface for stock portfolio management, integrating with the .NET backend and external APIs for a seamless user experience.

---

## 1. Architecture & Structure
- **Framework:** React (CRA) + TypeScript
- **Main Directories:**
  - `src/Components/`: Modular UI components (cards, dashboard, forms, etc.)
  - `src/Pages/`: Top-level pages/routes (Home, Login, Register, Search, Company, etc.)
  - `src/Context/`: React Contexts for authentication and global state
  - `src/Services/`: API service wrappers for backend communication
  - `src/Models/`: TypeScript types and interfaces for data models
  - `src/Routes/`: Route definitions and protected route logic
  - `src/Helpers/`: Utility functions and helpers
  - `src/api.tsx`: Main API integration module for backend and external API calls

---

## 2. Key Business Logic & Workflows

### A. Authentication & User Management
- **Context-based Auth:**
  - `useAuth` context manages user state, JWT token, and authentication flows.
  - Stores user and token in local storage for persistence.
  - Provides login, registration, and logout functions.
  - Protects routes using a `ProtectedRoute` component; redirects unauthenticated users to login.

### B. Portfolio Management
- **Features:**
  - Users can view, add, and remove stocks from their portfolio.
  - Portfolio state is synced with backend via API calls.
  - Components: `ListPortfolio`, `AddPortfolio`, and portfolio-related logic in `SearchPage`.

### C. Stock & Company Search
- **Features:**
  - Users can search for stocks/companies by name or symbol.
  - Search results are displayed as cards with options to view more details or add to portfolio.
  - Components: `Search`, `CardList`, `Card`.

### D. Company Profile & Financial Data
- **Features:**
  - Detailed company profile pages show key metrics, cashflow, and dividend history.
  - Fetches data from both backend and directly from external APIs (e.g., Financial Modeling Prep).
  - Components: `CompanyPage`, `CompanyDashboard`, `CompanyProfile`, `CashflowStatement`, `HistoricalDividend`.

### E. Comments
- **Features:**
  - Users can view and post comments on stocks.
  - Comments are fetched from and posted to the backend.
  - Components: `StockComment`, `StockCommentList`, `StockCommentForm`.

---

## 3. Data Models & Types
- **UserProfile:** Stores user info (username, email).
- **Portfolio:** Represents user's stock holdings.
- **Stock/Company:** Symbol, company name, financial metrics, etc.
- **Comment:** Title, content, author.
- **TypeScript interfaces** are used throughout for type safety.

---

## 4. API Integration
- **Backend:** Communicates with .NET backend via RESTful endpoints (e.g., `/api/portfolio`, `/api/stock`, `/api/comment`).
- **Authentication:** JWT Bearer tokens are included in requests for protected endpoints.
- **External APIs:** Directly fetches certain financial data (e.g., cashflow, dividends) from Financial Modeling Prep.
- **Service wrappers** in `src/Services/` and `src/api.tsx` handle API logic and error handling.

---

## 5. UI/UX & Styling
- **Component-based design:** Modular, reusable components for all UI elements.
- **Pages** correspond to main user flows (Home, Login, Register, Search, Company, etc.).
- **Navigation:** React Router for client-side routing.
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS for rapid, responsive, and modern UI design.
- **Feedback:** Toast notifications for success/error events.

---

## 6. Security & State Management
- **Authentication state** is managed via React Context and local storage.
- **Protected routes** ensure only authenticated users can access sensitive pages (portfolio, comments, etc.).
- **Form validation** using React Hook Form and Yup.

---

## 7. Error Handling & Validation
- **API errors** are caught and displayed to the user via toast notifications.
- **Form errors** are validated and shown inline.
- **Graceful fallback** for missing or incomplete data (e.g., no dividend history).

---

## 8. Extensibility & Best Practices
- **Separation of concerns**: Logic is separated into services, contexts, and components.
- **Type safety**: TypeScript interfaces and types are used throughout.
- **Reusable components**: UI is modular for easy extension and maintenance.
- **Clear API boundaries**: All backend and external API calls are abstracted into service layers.

## 9. Summary Table of Main Components
| Component         | Purpose                                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| useAuth           | Auth context for login, register, logout, state |
| ProtectedRoute    | Route protection for authenticated users        |
| SearchPage        | Search for stocks, manage portfolio             |
| CompanyPage       | View company profile and financials             |
| StockComment      | View and post comments on stocks                |
| Card/CardList     | Display search results and actions              |
| ListPortfolio     | Display user's portfolio                        |
| api.tsx           | API integration for backend and FMP             |

## 10. Example User Flows
- **Register/Login:** User registers or logs in; token and user info stored in context/local storage.
- **Search/Add to Portfolio:** User searches for a stock, views details, and adds it to their portfolio.
- **Portfolio Management:** User views and removes stocks from portfolio.
- **Company Profile:** User views detailed company info, metrics, and comments.
- **Commenting:** User posts and views comments on a stock profile.

---

## 11. Integration Points
- **Backend:** All core data and business actions are performed via RESTful API calls to the .NET backend.
- **External:** Direct calls to Financial Modeling Prep for detailed financial data.

---

## 12. Development Practices
- **React Hooks** for state and lifecycle management.
- **React Context** for global state (auth, user).
- **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability.
- **TailwindCSS** for modern, responsive design.
- **Modular codebase** for easy scaling and collaboration.
